Anonymster was founded in 2016 by two friends passionate about Internet privacy and security. The idea behind the project was to promote awareness about the dangers of surfing the net and provide practical solutions to protect personal data and privacy. It was the foundersâ€™ concern to explain Internet privacy and security in simple term, making the information accessible even to inexperienced users https://anonymster.com/.
